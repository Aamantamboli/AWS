### Step 6: Download Your Access Key
Once the access key is created, you will see the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**. Make sure to download the key file or copy the keys somewhere safe, as you wonâ€™t be able to see the secret key again.

## Important Notes
- **Keep Your Keys Secure**: Never share your access keys. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles whenever possible.
- **Rotate Your Keys Regularly**: For security reasons, regularly rotate your access keys.

## Conclusion
You have successfully created an access key in AWS! Use it to access AWS services programmatically.
