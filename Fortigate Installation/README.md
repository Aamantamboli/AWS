## Step 4: Launch the Instance and Access it via Browser

1. Follow the standard EC2 instance launch process (select instance type, configure instance details, add storage, configure security group).
2. Ensure that you open **TCP Port 3000** in your security group to allow access to FortiGateâ€™s web interface.
3. Once the instance is launched, you will see the **Public IP** of your instance. Copy this IP address.
4. Open a browser and enter the following URL, replacing `your-public-ip` with the actual public IP address of the instance:
   
   ```
   https://your-public-ip:3000
   ```

## Important Notes

- **Security Group**: Ensure that **TCP port 3000** is open in the security group of your EC2 instance. This is essential to access the FortiGate web interface.
- **Username**: The default username is `admin`.
- **Password**: The default password is the **Instance ID** at the time of launch. Make sure to reset the password once you log in.
