## Conclusion

Youâ€™ve successfully set up a Transit Gateway in AWS, connected three VPCs, launched instances within each VPC, and verified communication between the instances across the VPCs.

Make sure your security group rules and route tables are configured correctly to allow the necessary traffic for inter-VPC communication.
