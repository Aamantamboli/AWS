## Step 2: Search for the FortiGate AMI

1. In the **AWS EC2 Dashboard**, under **Launch Instance**, go to the **Marketplace** tab.
2. Search for **FortiGate** in the search bar to find the available FortiGate AMI.

## Step 3: Select and Subscribe to the FortiGate AMI

1. Select the appropriate **FortiGate AMI** for your version (e.g., FortiGate 7.0.0).
2. Click **Select** to start the instance configuration.
3. You will be asked to **Subscribe** to the FortiGate AMI if you haven't already. Follow the on-screen prompts to subscribe.

## Step 4: Launch the Instance and Access it via Browser

1. Follow the standard EC2 instance launch process (select instance type, configure instance details, add storage, configure security group).
2. Ensure that you open **TCP Port 3000** in your security group to allow access to FortiGateâ€™s web interface.
3. Once the instance is launched, you will see the **Public IP** of your instance. Copy this IP address.

4. Open a browser and enter the following URL, replacing `your-public-ip` with the actual public IP address of the instance:
   
   ```
   https://your-public-ip:3000
   ```

## Step 5: Login to FortiGate Web Interface

- **Username**: The default username is `admin`.
- **Password**: The default password is the **Instance ID** at the time of launch. Make sure to reset the password once you log in.
